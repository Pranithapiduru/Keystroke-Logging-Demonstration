## Project Title
# Keystroke Logging Demonstration
## Project Description
This project is an educational demonstration of keystroke logging developed using Python. 
It showcases how keyboard input events can be captured at the operating system level in a 
controlled and ethical manner. The application provides a graphical user interface that 
allows users to start and stop logging with full transparency and consent.

## Objectives
- To demonstrate how keystroke logging works
- To understand OS-level keyboard event handling
- To create awareness about cybersecurity threats
- To promote ethical and responsible use of security concepts
## Technologies Used
- Python
- Tkinter (GUI)
- pynput (Keyboard event handling)
- Text & JSON file storage
- Visual Studio Code
## Features
- GUI-based keystroke logging
- Start and stop logging controls
- Local data storage
- Transparent and ethical execution
- Simple and user-friendly interface
## Project Workflow
1. User launches the application
2. GUI window appears
3. User starts keystroke logging
4. Keyboard inputs are captured
5. Data is stored locally
6. User stops logging and exits
## Output
- A GUI window titled "Keystroke Logger Demo"
- Status updates for logging activity
- A text file containing logged keystrokes with timestamps
