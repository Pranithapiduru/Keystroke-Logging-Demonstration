Keystroke Logging Demonstration

This project is an educational demonstration of keystroke logging developed using Python. It explains how keyboard input events can be captured at the operating system level in a controlled and ethical manner. The project is designed to create awareness about cybersecurity threats such as keyloggers and to help learners understand how such mechanisms work internally.
